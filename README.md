# simpleSwiftFreeboxRemote
It's a simple iOS remote for the [Freebox Player](http://www.free.fr/adsl/freebox-revolution.html), using the HTTP API (which is slowly being deprecated but I just wanted to test Swift with a little project) for channel changing only.

*Feel free to use this code for your own application, but keep in mind that I'm a Swift beginner so it's at your own risks.
I've used autolayout in order to make this app compatible with most of the iOS devices in iOS 8.3.*
